We gave our solution to a colleague for code review. Unfortunately, he
rejects it because it does not follow the "Open-closed principle", as he claims.

Task:
* What is this "Open-closed principle"?
* Why does it matter here?
* Which could be cases where it wouldn't be relevant?
* Let's dicuss and adjust our solution accordingly!
