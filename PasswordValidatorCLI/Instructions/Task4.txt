Our customer reports that now it's even necessary to give feedback to the users
which of the password rules are violated by the password they try to specify.
If multiple rules are violated, all validation errors should be shown.

Task:

* Change the password validator according to the new requirement
* Discuss whether or not the Open-closed principle helped us here and
    compare it with the initial solution
