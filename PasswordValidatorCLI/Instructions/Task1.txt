Introduction:
We currently have a customer for whom our team develops an internal web application.
The application has no access to any kind of identity management system, thus all
users create an account and authenticate using basic authentication with user name and password.

Today, our customer recognized that currently there is no validation at all for the passwords users specify in our
application. Users can even specify an empty string as a password and it will be accepted! He asks us
to create a component for password validation and to provide him with a command line app which he can use to
test the validation.  

Task:
Our customer asks us to implement the following:
* A password must have at least 6 characters
* A password must contain at least one number
* The command line tool should tell whether a password that is entered is valid or not
